# My nvim config
This is a backup repo for my nvim config. It's a permanent work in progress.

I started to think of using nvim after watching [The Primeagen's](https://www.youtube.com/c/theprimeagen) videos. But it was not enough to start. I could not get <code>telescope</code> to work 
(I just wasn't aware of prerequisities: <code>fd</code> and <code>rg</code> commands). I thought it was due to the fact that I was using Windows. But in Ubuntu it was basically the same - error after error... 

After RTFM and some googling I was able to resolve this and I was ready.

But hey, there came another obstacle. I use Scala quite extensivelly and it seems that the only person in the Universe that is using nvim with Scala is [Chris Kipp](https://www.youtube.com/@ChrisKipp/featured). 
His videos were helpfull (even autocompletion worked :smile:) but I could not quite understand what was hound on under the hood.

At las I came across [typecraft](https://www.youtube.com/@typecraft_dev) amazing tutorial series and this was it! 
I combined <code>scala-metals</code> with Python and other languages and I am officially starting my nvim adventure :smile:
